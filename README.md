# Final-SEED-Lab-Controller-Code
This contains the final code to control the SEED Lab robot with a PI controller. 

This code is for a propriatory robot, so without detailed assembly instructions, cannot be recreated. However, this code showcases the use of the PI controller to follow a blue line autonomously. This code utilizes a finite state machine, based on the signals it recieves from the computer vision, to control the movement of the robot along a blue line.
